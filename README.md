## Kate O'Neill Github pages!

### Introduction
Hi! 👋 My name's Kate. I'm a fourth year Creative Computing Student at South East Technological University in Ireland. 🇮🇪

This page is to showcase my work completed and available for viewing on my github page. ✅

I've been busy over the last year building up projects that I'm proud to display. 🏆

I mainly work in HTML, SCSS and PHP(through laravel) with a keen interest in web development but this past semester during a "Software Development Tools" module I got more familiar with Github and started using Kotlin 😁. This was a big change from what I was used to but it was nice learning curve. 

### Projects
This is mainly going to be used to showcase my Kotlin projects, they are as follows:

- [Employee app](https://github.com/kateoneill/employee-app)
My first Kotlin assignment involved creating an employee app, loaded in dummy data and podcued a payslip while running a handful of functions

- [Notes app](https://github.com/kateoneill/notes-app)
My second Kotlin assignment, you can see the progression with introduction of unit testing as well as the beginnings of a new Github workflow. You can now add and updates notes and run a plethora of cool functions. Still a console app.

- [Book-shelf](https://github.com/kateoneill/book-shelf)
My most recent assignment involving 2 models (Author and Book) where book is an array inside Author, with testing and increased tooling as well as the inclusion of Github actions, this is the most advanced Kotlin assignment for sure. You can run various functions on the models and the UI is book-themed.
